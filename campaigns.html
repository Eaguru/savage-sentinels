					<div class="col-md-6">
						<h3>"In the sleepy coastal town of Sandpoint, evil is brewing. An attack by crazed goblins during the annual Swallowtail Festival quickly turns into something more ominous as the shadows of a dark past come back to haunt the town—and perhaps all of Varisia. Can the heroes stop the awakening of a legendary runelord and keep him from reclaiming his lost kingdom of greed?"</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>The original Savage Sentinels adventure, starting off in the coastal town of Sandpoint of Varisia. After fending off a horde of crazed goblins during a festival to celebrate the consecration of a new temple, the Sentinels band together to find out where these goblins are coming from. An ancient, unfamiliar rune emerges and the Sentinels set off to find out what's going on.</p>
						<p>The group eventually ends up at Thistletop, surrounded by the ocean and steep cliffsides. The Sentinels fight off another horde of goblins and venture deeper into the building, discovering a dungeon inside. Unfortunately for them, three of the Sentinels go missing and their bard is mangled by a giant crab. With most of the Sentinels missing and their dear companion dead, the Sentinels disband and allow the fabled Runelords to stake their claim over Varisia.</p>

						<h3>"Called by the Elder Elemental Eye to serve, four corrupt prophets have risen from the depths of anonymity to claim mighty weapons with direct links to the power of the elemental princes. Each of these prophets has assembled a cadre of cultists and creatures to serve them in the construction of four elemental temples of lethal design. It is up to adventurers to discover where the true power of each prophet lay, and dismantle it before it comes boiling up to obliterate the Realms."</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>The next group of Sentinels arrive in the town of Red Larch, nestled in the Dessarin Valley just off the Sword Coast of Faerun. After tackling some local problems regarding a missing delegation from the Northern town of Mirabar and proving themselves worthy adventurers, they uncover rumours of cults in and around the town. After unearthing the machinations of the Black Earth cult right underneath Red Larch, the Sentinels decided to seek out the other cults.</p>
						<p>Over the following weeks, they discover the cults and hideouts of the cults: Feathergale Spire of the Howling Hatred; the Sacred Stone Monastery of the Black Earth; the Rivergard Keep of the Crushing Wave; and Scarlet Moon Hall of the Eternal Flame. They learn of the prophets who seek to bring forth the Princes of Elemental Evil back into the world of Faerun, and must put a stop to them—albeit, out of selfish reasons (namely, not wanting to die).</p>
						<p>They overthrow the prophets of air and fire, using their legendary weapons of Belsimer to seal the portals of air and fire. They halt a stop to the summoning of Yan-C-Bin, the Prince of Elemental Air, and Imix, the Prince of Elemental Fire. Unfortunately both Olhydra, the Princess of Elemental Air, and Ogremoch, the Prince of Elemental Earth are both summoned. Through impossible odds, the Sentinels enlist the aid of the former cult co-leaders and manage to fight tooth and nail to overcome the two Princes.</p>
						<p>With the Princes of Elemental Evil sealed and subdued, the danger to the Dessarin Valley and Faerun at large have been put to rest and the Sentinels bask in their triumph over such primeval evils. They put their swords aside and hope to finally take some well-earned rest.</p>

				<h1>The Tomb of Horrors</h1>
				<h2>Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, AD&D module adapted by Chris Perkins<br>
				DMed by Dan</h2>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<h3>"In the far reaches of the world, under a lost and lonely hill, lies the sinister Tomb of Horrors. This labyrinthine crypt is filled with terrible traps, strange and ferocious monsters, rich and magical treasures, and somewhere within rests the evil Demi-Lich Acererak."</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>The Savage Sentinels had heard of the Tomb of Horrors. Stuff of legends; you know how the story goes. An infamous tomb housing treasures of ages lost. All ripe for the taking. Many enter; none return. Of course, the Sentinels would definitely be the first to brave the caves and be the ones to finally triumph over this veritable nest of evil and decay.</p>
						<p>Upon entering the tomb, the Sentinels find themselves overwhelmed by the deadly traps strewn about. The legends were definitely not lies; every single step was a brush with death. Pit falls into deadly poison spikes, and their halfling barbarian immediately being disintegrated by the infamous green devil face immediately brought a massive sense of humility to the Sentinels.</p>
						<p>They press onward, falling to traps one by one. They eventually find what was supposedly the corpse of the demi-lich Acererak, but it was a hollow victory. With their equipment magically stripped from them and most of their companions dead, it turns out their gaunt wizard was holding back a secret the whole time: he was a vampire. Out of panic and fear, he enacts his "Plan: Omega"—that is, feasting on his newfound companions for sustenance before fleeing the tomb with his life.</p>
						<p>This branch of the Sentinels faded into history, with contact from them halting without warning. Nobody knows what fate befell them to this day.</p>

						<h3>"Tipped off by a Drow contact in the Zhentarim, the Sentinels learn of a fabled artifact—the Ring of Three Wishes. They set out on an adventure to secure the ring and the magical codex that reveals its location, only to find trouble abound. The treasure they seek is even more than they could have possibly imagined..."</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>After subduing the Princes of Elemental Evil, the Sentinels are contacted by a Drow they had encountered in during their travels. He bears the mark of the Zhentarim and offers them an incredibly lucrative job, helping them seize a rare artifact of power in exchange for an inordinate amount of wealth. A quick <em>geas</em> spell pries his lips open of secrets and the Sentinels set out to find the <em>Ring of Three Wishes</em>, as it supposedly called.</p>
						<p>They find the locations of three fragments of a stone tablet, which would reveal the ring's location. They raid the fortified vaults of the magic shop proprieter Mael'zahron, plundering his vaults of his most prized treasures and relieving him of the tablet fragment. With the fragment they learn that the remaining fragments are in the Underdark, and in possession of the Zhentarim.</p>
						<p>Making their way through the perilous Underdark proved to be quite a journey. They encounter a rival group from the Zhentarim, whom they briefly ally with on their way to the great library of Gravenhollow to discern more information about the ring. They find out it's actually buried deep beneath Menzoberranzen, the City of Spiders and home to the Drow. They also find out it's actually a Crown of Wishes that tends to drives the wielder mad, crafted by celestials and guarded by a Solar named Anahiel.</p>
						<p>Not allowing this to deter them, they journey to the deepest parts of the Underdark and find that the sacred chambers have been overtaken by a colony of mindflayers. They fight their way through the mindflayer nest and managed to defeat the elder brain of the colony, eventually finding themselves in the innermost sanctum where Anahiel and the crown lay.</p>
						<p>They fight valiantly, but Anahiel proves to be a powerful opponent. With several of the Sentinels on the brink of death, they make a simple plan: run for it, sealing Anahiel in the chamber and making away with the crown by the skin of their teeth. With the Solar trapped in his inner sanctum the Sentinels make use of the crown to restore a destroyed Red Larch back to its former glory. The Sentinel's captain, Lightsky, then makes off with the crown to unknown lands, leaving the rest of the group to live out their days in peace.</p>

						<h3>"Under raging storm clouds, the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich stands silhouetted against the ancient walls of Castle Ravenloft. Rumbling thunder pounds the castle spires. The wind’s howling increases as he turns his gaze down toward the village of Barovia. A lightning flash rips through the darkness, but Strahd is gone. Only the howling of the wind fills the midnight air. The master of Castle Ravenloft is having guests for dinner—and you are invited."</h3>

						<p>The Sentinels return to the tabletop with the Curse of Strahd, their current campaign. They travel to the darkened land of Barovia within Ravenloft, where Strahd has smothered the land in an oppressive darkness and gloom.</p>
						<p>Accepting a dinner invitation from a Countess Morowin, the Sentinels are tasked with dispersing some stubborn vagrants who have set up camp outside the village of Daggerford. The villagers agree to leave—but only if the group agrees to champion their cause of freeing their beloved prince in a "nearby town," known as Barovia.</p>
						<p>The Sentinels stride headfirst into a mysterious silvery mist. They emerge in a land unknown to them and far from home, unbeknownst to them. What mysteries and dark secrets does this Barovia have in store for them?</p>
