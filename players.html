						<h1>Dan</h1>
						<h2>Jizt Blo'Urden, Quivering Snow of Sleeping Frost<br><span id="dm">DM of Princes of the Apocalypse, Tomb of Horrors, Savage Seconds</span></h2>
						<p>The main DM of the Savage Sentinels. Having wanted to try D&D for years, an opportune moment popped up when a few people expressed interest in trying the game with <a href="#james">James</a> willing to take up the mantle as DM under the 4<sup>th</sup> edition and Pathfinder rulesets. This led to the formation of the <em>Gilded Guild</em>  group. When this group eventually fell apart, it reformed using the 5<sup>th</sup> edition ruleset with Dan taking up the role as DM under the moniker the <em>Savage Sentinels</em>. The rest is history.</p>
						<aside>
							<blockquote>
								<p>"You can try. Go ahead&mdash;roll for it."</p>

						</aside>
						<h3>Jizt Blo'Urden</h3>
						<h4>Dragonborn paladin, Oath of the Ancients, chaotic good</h4>
						<p>A devout follower of the goddess Llira, Jizt seeks pleasure and joy, hoping to spread it to those around her. She despises evil, and anything that seeks to harm others. She speaks in the third person with fragmented sentences, with a childlike naivete oozing from every word. Despite her antics and lack of social tact, it's hard for those around her to get upset when she's so earnest.</p>
						<h3>Quivering Snow, of Sleeping Frost</h3>
						<h4>Tabaxi monk, Way of the Four Elements, chaotic good</h4>
						<p>Hailing from a dying clan of snow Tabaxi, Snow is her village's loremaster and sage advisor. She seeks to learn more about the outside world, as her peoples' knowledge died with her mother during a frost giant raid. Ever curious and pragmatic, Snow likes learning new things and sifting through books or picking the minds of learned individuals. She hopes to return home one day with a trove of worldly knowledge.</p>

						<h1>James</h1>
						<h2>Captain Lightsky<br><span id="dm">DM of Rise of the Runelords, Curse of Strahd</span></h2>
						<p>The OG of all the players, James has experience in several tabletop games and rulesets. His particular interest in the Pathfinder ruleset brought the Sentinels together. Though James can be a bit aloof and enigmatic, there is a strange level of fondness and trust in him. He's the captain, after all.</p>

						</aside>
						<h3>Lightsky</h3>
						<h4>Drow bard, College of Valor, chaotic neutral</h4>
						<p>Even more cryptic and distant than the player, Lightsky is a natural leader with his unwavering confidence. The Sentinels follow him without question, for the Captain has never steered them wrong&mdash;and when he has, it was definitely part of the master plan.</p>
						<p>The love of his life was taken from him by a vengeful hand and it was his own thirst for vengeance that drew him away from his home in the Underdark. Upon eventually travelling to the Dessarin valley the Sentinels met him and have followed him faithfully ever since.</p>

						<h1>Anne</h1>
						<h2>Amelia Thorne, Maze</h2>
						<p>Anne had absolutely no tabletop RPG experience under her belt whatsoever when she joined the Sentinels at <a href="#dan">Dan's</a> behest. Scared and clueless, she remained in the background quietly calculating. She's since come to enjoy D&D and is the Sentinels' veritable pocket-sized destroyer.</p>
						<aside>
							<blockquote>
								<p>"Huh?! I can't see shit!"</p>
							</blockquote>
						</aside>
						<h3>Amelia Thorne</h3>
						<h4>Human cleric of Torm, Domain of War, chaotic good</h4>
						<p>Amelia is a reserved and polite woman. She heaves around massive weaponry several sizes too large for her own good and uses these implements to dispense her divine justice. Though she is as kind as she can be, should she be wronged or her companions placed in danger she is the first to jump into the fray. She swings her monumental arms with ease. Her calm demeanor at ease and wrathful disposition in combat give the Sentinels very good reason to keep her around&mdash;and stay on her good side at all times.</p>
						<h3>Maze</h3>
						<h4>Half-elf sorcerer, Sea Sorcery, chaotic good</h4>
						<p>Not much is known about Maze, as her name would imply. She dresses nicely and keeps herself well-groomed. The only thing the Sentinels know about Maze are that she wields strange sorcerous powers, and that she is constantly vigilant when it comes to finding beautiful people.</p>

						<h1>Joseph</h1>
						<h2>Assamungus Dicklick, Asa DeMungus Dikka-lik, Thalamor Bigtall Dingin</h2>
						<p>Joseph's first experience with D&D involved him getting stabbed to death in the first hour with the <em>Gilded Guild</em>. Put off by this, Joe abstained from playing until the formation of the Sentinels. With a much more positive experience this time around, Joe has managed to stick around and be the loveable airheaded hard-head&mdash;when he's not zoning out or falling asleep.</p>
						<aside>
							<blockquote>
								<p>"Yeah, well... your eye is a bitch, and <strong>you're</strong> a bitch!"</p>
							</blockquote>
						</aside>
						<h3>Asa DeMungus Dikka-lik</h3>
						<h4>Half-orc fighter, Battlemaster, chaotic neutral</h4>
						<p>A rough past haunts Asa. Growing up as a chef on a military encampment, a raid by a band of assassins known as the Defthands left his parents and friends dead. With nothing but two potlids to defend himself, Asa managed to escape to live another day. He has since sworn to protect those in need with his massive shields and stands with the Sentinels as their stout defender.</p>
						<h3>Thalamor Bigtall Dingin</h3>
						<h4>Goliath cleric of Pelor, Domain of Light, neutral good</h4>
						<p>Thalamor Bigtall Dingin looms over most humanoids. Despite his menacing presence, he is a gentle soul who only looks to spread the light of Pelor as far as he can. What is most curious is his forsaking of the traditional cleric implements in favour of strange contraptions that fire metal pellets with a thundering boom. Few know what these implements are; fewer still are those who live to tell the tale.</p>

						<h1>Varun</h1>
						<h2>Va'Roon, Atom-bum, J-I-JO</h2>
						<p>Varun joined the <em>Gilded Guild</em> for D&D after <a href="#joseph">Joseph's</a> poor luck with the initial sessions. Not too differently from Joe, Varun found himself at the mercy of bad rolls, managing to nearly drown in foot-deep water. To this day Varun's bravado and cockiness is only surpassed by his ability to roll natural 1's and fail when his group needs it the most.</p>
						<aside>

								<p>"Yooo dawg, we gettin' <strong>fucked</strong> tonight, naw'm sayin'?"</p>
							</blockquote>
						</aside>
						<h3>Atom-bum</h3>
						<h4>Dragonborn warlock, Pact of the Fiend, chaotic good</h4>
						<p>Atom-bum is an interesting warlock, for she made a pact with an elder fiend in exchange for great power; not for personal gain, but to protect those around her. Atom-bum's haughty nature only allows her to protect those she deems weak and worthy of her protection. The catch? She can't help but find everybody reprehensibly beneath her. The Sentinels figure it's best not to ask, so long as she does her job as the group's major magical practicioner.</p>
						<h3>J-I-JO</h3>
						<h4>Firbolg barbarian, Path of the Zealot, chaotic neutral</h4>
						<p>J-I-JO (or "JJ" as the group calls him, since nobody knows how to properly pronounce it) is the only person in the group to match Thalamor's. Unlike Thalamor however, JJ has quite the contrary temperament. His ire is quick to draw and his rage cannot be contained once it spills free. He is conscious of the natural world around him and though he can be seemingly brash and heartless, JJ does what he can to preserve it.</p>

						<h1>Aya</h1>
						<h2>Aya Diroller, Matrim Kelsier, San Tanyan</h2>
						<p>Aya is the Sentinel's premiere cheeky bastard and poor decision maker. His antics and banter know no end. From the conception of the <em>Gilded Guild</em> to the current days of the Sentinels, Aya has proven to be overly creative; especially when the situation doesn't call for it. His most notable feats include stabbing himself in the foot with a cursed unholy arrow, murdering a tanner's wife with five thousand ball bearings, and claiming to have murdered the Prince of Elemental Air by himself.</p>
						<aside>
							<blockquote>
								<p>"I killed a <strong>god</strong>, you know! You can call me Matrim, the Godslayer."</p>
							</blockquote>
						</aside>
						<h3>Matrim Kelsier</h3>
						<h4>High elf rogue, Assassin, chaotic neutral</h4>
						<p>Matrim is a shady fellow. He trusts his companions about as much as he trusts his archnemeses. Always on edge and ready to thrown down the glove with his arsenal of daggers, Matrim at best can only be described as "unsavory," to put it politely. His greedy fingers are as fast as his wit, and his relationship with the Captain is rather tumultuous&mdash;it's a miracle he has managed to stay by the Sentinels' side for as long as he has.</p>
						<h3>San Tanyan</h3>
						<h4>Half-elf rogue, Swashbuckler, chaotic neutral</h4>
						<p>San is a simple merchant peddling spices and common wares. He's definitely not a silver-tongued devil&mdash;no sir, these are the finest wares and prices you'll find around&mdash;and he is as honest as it gets. The rapiers are just for show.</p>

						<h1>Andrew</h1>
						<h2>Tyrande, Kazuko</h2>
						<p>Andrew was late in joining the <em>Gilded Guild</em>, and even then real-life commitments prevented him from joining the Sentinels on a regular basis. With his commitments handled and life smoothed out, Andrew made a triumphant return to the table to show them how things are <em>really</em> done. Andrew takes no prisoners: if he's challenged in any way, expect to butt heads.</p>
						<aside>
							<blockquote>
								<p>"I rapidly shift my body into a hundred different things. Something this man has never seen in his life."</p>
							</blockquote>
						</aside>
						<h3>Tyrande</h3>
						<h4>Water genasi druid, Circle of the Moon, neutral evil</h4>
						<p>Tyrande was raised by the wild; nurtured by it. Her natural connection to the world is where she draws her powers from and she considers civilisation a blight upon the world. One of her most notable traits is her unrelenting resentment towards anyone she perceives as wronging her. It is with this fury that she defends her honour and her homelands.</p>
						<h3>Kazuko</h3>
						<h4>Fallen aasimar warlock, Pact of the Dreadmother, chaotic neutral</h4>
						<p>Kazuko is as every bit mysterious as Maze; perhaps moreso. Her eyes ache with an eerily deep pain, as though something were consuming her from the inside out. She speaks nothing of it but the Sentinels can't help but feel there is a very dark secret she is holding back&mdash;and hopefully whatever it is, that it stays held back.</p>
